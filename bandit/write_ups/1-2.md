## About

[Level 1-2 Page](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit2.html)

This level is designed to introduce you to special characters within
filenames and how to handle.

`-` is a special character within the context of the shell.

## Steps 

1. Log into the server:

*If you followed the shortcut instructions in `pre-req.md`:*

`$ ssh bandit0@otw`


*If not:*

`$ ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220`


2. List files in the directory:

`$ ls`


3. Note that the only file visible in the directory appears to be
 named `-`, which is a special character within the context of the
 shell. The special character must be handled
 correctly or an error will be raised. 

 There are several methods to handle a special character:
 Use the `cat` command with one of the following methods to view the
 contents of the file:

 1. Escape (using `\`):

 `$ cat \-`

 
 2. Encapsulated within quotation marks:

 `$ cat "-"`


 3. Contained within the path (`.` denotes the *current working directory*):

 `$ cat ./-`


4.  Copy the password and log out of the server:

`Ctrl-D`
